---------------		---------------
create_synthetic_ds1.py	Creates synthetic datasets with: one spatially varying earthquake constant, one spatially varying site
				constant, and one spatially independent site constant
create_synthetic_ds2.py	Creates synthetic datasets with: one spatially varying earthquake constant, one spatially varying site
				constant, one spatially independent site constant, and cell specific anelastic attenuation (spatially 
				varying and independent component) 
create_synthetic_ds3.py	Creates synthetic datasets with: one spatially varying earthquake constant, one spatially varying site
				constant, one spatially independent site constant, a spatially varying geometrical spreading term that is 
				a function of the earthquake coordinates, a spatially varying Vs30 scaling term that is a function of the
				site coordinates and cell specific anelastic attenuation (spatially varying and independent component)
