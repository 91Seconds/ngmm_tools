description = "This repository contains software tools for developing Nonergodic Ground Motion Models (NGMMs) based on the varying coefficient (Landwehr et al., 2016) and cell-specific anelastic attention approach (Dawood and Rodriguez‚ÄêMarek, 2013). Developed tools are available for R using the statistical package (R-INLA, https://www.r-inla.org/) and in python using the CMDSTAN and PYSTAN interface packages for the Bayesian software (Stan, https://mc-stan.org/). Documentation and detailed instructions on the use of the developed tools is provided in Lavrentiadis et al., 2022a GIRS report. A general introduction and considerations for the development of NGMMs are presented in Lavrentiadis et al., 2022b."
